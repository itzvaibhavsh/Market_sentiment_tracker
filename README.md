# 📉 Market_Sentiment_Tracker

This project analyzes financial news headlines using sentiment analysis to determine whether the news is positive, negative, or neutral — and correlates it with market price movements.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project was built as part of my preparation for Axxela's campus placement process at NIT Durgapur. It showcases my understanding of:

- Financial markets
- Sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Python-based data processing with TextBlob and pandas
- Excel-based quantitative tracking

📁 Files Included:
- **Untitled2.ipynb** — Python notebook for collecting, analyzing, and exporting headline sentiment data  
- **InteractiveSheet.xlsx** — Output Excel file containing analyzed headlines and corresponding next-day price comparison

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Financial headlines are provided to the script as sample data.
2. Python’s TextBlob library is used to analyze each headline’s sentiment.
3. Headlines are labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
4. Real or simulated market price movement for the next day is added for correlation.
5. Final result is saved to an Excel file: InteractiveSheet.xlsx

## ⚙ Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) (can also run in Jupyter Notebook)
- TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- pandas (for data handling and Excel export)
- Excel (for final data view and formatting)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to apply NLP for real-world financial analysis
- The correlation between news sentiment and market price reactions
- Basics of building project pipelines — coding + analysis + Excel output
- How to publish and version a project using GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps

In future versions, I plan to:
- Scrape real-time financial news using NewsAPI or RSS feeds
- Automate price tracking via Yahoo Finance API
- Visualize sentiment vs price trends using Matplotlib or Plotly
